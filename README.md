# YT-Downloader

This Python tool can download YouTube-Videos in multiple resolutions. There is also an option to display the available streams of a video. 

Different options are available to use. There is a 1080p version, a bestquality version and one where you can choose the stream you like based on the stream id that will be printed out in the console. 

To use this or to work on it, create a virtual environment and install the required packages specified in the "requirements.txt" file. 

When running the script, provide necessary user input to continue and enjoy a very very simple YouTube downloader. Basically just a basic implementation of the library "pytube" itself.
